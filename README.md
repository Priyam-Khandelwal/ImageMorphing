# ImageMorphing
Image Morphing in OpenCV using delaunay triangulation algorithm and affine transformation

# Steps to use:
1. Modify the source and destination image names accordingly.
2. Set N and i equal to number of frames required.
3. Run the code and select control points in the source image and destination image. Order of selecting the points should be same so that same facial features are mapped correctly. For eg. left eye of source to left eye of destination.
